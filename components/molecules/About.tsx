            Iâ€™m Dwi, a front-end engineer based in Bandung, Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©. With 4 years of invaluable
            experience in the field, I have honed my skills in Vue.js, React.js, Next.js,
            TailwindCSS, and Typescript, allowing me to craft seamless and interactive user
            experiences that engage and delight users. My passion for web development extends beyond
            the front-end, as I also have a solid understanding of back-end frameworks such as
            Express.js and Nest.js, enabling me to create end-to-end solutions that are both robust
            and user-friendly. I thrive on staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and
            technologies, and I am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on
            exciting projects to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in web development.
